You can integrate the **CometChat Chat Builder widget** into your Webflow site by using the built-in Embed element in the Designer.

Once installed, it will:  
- Load and initialize the widget on page load  
- Automatically log in a predefined user  
- Display a docked chat window on your site  

<Steps>

  <Step title="Register on CometChat & Gather Your Keys">  
Before you begin, sign up at the [CometChat Dashboard](https://app.cometchat.com/) and create a new app. Copy:  
- **App ID**  
- **Region**  
- **Auth Key**  
</Step>

  <Step title="Open the Webflow Designer & Add an Embed">  
1. In your Webflow project, open the **Designer**.  
2. From the **Add** panel (A), drag the **Embed** component onto your page where you want the widget to appear.  
</Step>

  <Step title="Include the Chat‑Embed Script in Project Settings">  
1. In the Webflow Dashboard, navigate to **Project Settings → Custom Code → Head Code**.  
2. Paste:  

   ```html
   <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@cometchat/chat-embed@latest/dist/main.js"></script>
   ```  
3. Save changes and **Publish** your site.  
</Step>

  <Step title="Embed the Widget Container & Init Script">  
Back in the Designer, with your Embed component selected, click **Edit Custom Code** and paste:

   ```html lines highlight={4-6, 17}
   <div id="cometChatMount"></div>
   <script>
     const COMETCHAT_CREDENTIALS = {
       appID:     "<YOUR_APP_ID>",
       appRegion: "<YOUR_APP_REGION>",
       authKey:   "<YOUR_AUTH_KEY>",
     };
     const COMETCHAT_LAUNCH_OPTIONS = {
       targetElementID: "cometChatMount",
       isDocked:        true,
       width:           "100%",    /* adjust as needed */
       height:          "600px",   /* adjust as needed */
     };

     window.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
       CometChatApp.init(COMETCHAT_CREDENTIALS)
         .then(() => CometChatApp.login({ uid: "<USER_UID>" }))
         .then(() => CometChatApp.launch(COMETCHAT_LAUNCH_OPTIONS))
         .catch(error => console.error("[CometChat] Error:", error));
     });
   </script>
   ```

> Replace `<YOUR_APP_ID>`, `<YOUR_APP_REGION>`, `<YOUR_AUTH_KEY>`, and `<USER_UID>` with your actual CometChat credentials.  
</Step>

  <Step title="Publish & Test">  
- Click **Publish** in the Designer to push your changes to the live site.  
- Visit your published site to confirm the widget loads.  
</Step>

  <Step title="Troubleshooting">  
- **Widget not loading?**  
  - Verify your App ID, Region & Auth Key.  
  - Check the browser console for errors.  
- **Login fails?**  
  - Ensure `<USER_UID>` exists under **Users** in your CometChat Dashboard.  
- **Embed blank?**  
  - Make sure you republished the site after adding custom code.  
</Step>
