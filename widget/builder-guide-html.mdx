title: "Add CometChat Widget to a Static HTML Website"
description: "Learn how to embed the CometChat Chat Builder widget into a basic HTML website using script and DOM integration."
---

You can integrate the **CometChat Chat Builder widget** into any static HTML website by embedding a few lines of code directly into your HTML files.

Once installed, it will:
- Load and initialize the widget on page load  
- Automatically log in a predefined user  
- Display a docked chat window on your website  

<Steps>
  <Step title="Register on CometChat & Gather Your Keys">
Before you begin, sign up at the [CometChat Dashboard](https://app.cometchat.com/) and create a new app. Copy:
- **App ID**  
- **Region**  
- **Auth Key**
</Step>

<Step title="Include the Chat‑Embed Script in `<head>`">
Add this inside the `<head>` section of your HTML file to load the CometChat bundle:

```html
<script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@cometchat/chat-embed@latest/dist/main.js"></script>
```
</Step>

<Step title="Embed & Initialize the Widget in `<body>`">
Paste the following just before the closing `</body>` tag:

```html lines highlight={4-6, 17}
<div id="cometChatMount"></div>
<script>
  const COMETCHAT_CREDENTIALS = {
    appID:     "<YOUR_APP_ID>",
    appRegion: "<YOUR_APP_REGION>",
    authKey:   "<YOUR_AUTH_KEY>",
  };
  const COMETCHAT_LAUNCH_OPTIONS = {
    targetElementID: "cometChatMount",
    isDocked:        true,
    width:           "700px",
    height:          "400px",
  };

  window.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
    CometChatApp.init(COMETCHAT_CREDENTIALS)
      .then(() => CometChatApp.login({ uid: "<USER_UID>" }))
      .then(() => CometChatApp.launch(COMETCHAT_LAUNCH_OPTIONS))
      .catch(error => console.error("[CometChat] Error:", error));
  });
</script>
```

> Replace `<YOUR_APP_ID>`, `<YOUR_APP_REGION>`, `<YOUR_AUTH_KEY>`, and `<USER_UID>` with your actual CometChat credentials.

</Step>

<Step title="Troubleshooting">
- **Widget not loading?** Check the browser console for errors and verify your App ID and Region.  
- **User login fails?** Ensure the `<USER_UID>` exists under **Users** in your CometChat Dashboard.  
- **Script blocked?** Confirm you’re using the correct `<script>` URL and that no CSP or adblockers are preventing it.
</Step>
</Steps>
