You can integrate the **CometChat Visual Builder widget** into any static HTML website by embedding a few lines of code directly into your HTML files.

## **What You‚Äôll Build**

- Load and initialize the widget on page load
- Automatically log in a predefined user
- Display a docked chat window on your website

## **Register on CometChat and Get Your Application Keys**

Before integrating CometChat, you need to create an account and obtain your App ID, Region, and Auth Key.

### **Steps**

1. Go to [CometChat Dashboard](https://app.cometchat.com/) and sign up for a free account.
2. Create a new app by clicking **+ Add App**.
3. Note down the following credentials from the created app:
   - **App ID**
   - **Region**
   - **Auth Key**

## **Embed the CometChat Widget in Your HTML Page**

Add this in head section of your HTML file to include the CometChat script:

```html
<script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@cometchat/chat-embed@latest/dist/main.js"></script>
```

Paste the following code directly into your HTML file inside the `<body>` section, just before the closing `</body>` tag:

```html
<div id="cometChatMount"></div>
<script>
  const COMETCHAT_CREDENTIALS = {
    appID: "<YOUR_APP_ID>",
    appRegion: "<YOUR_APP_REGION>",
    authKey: "<YOUR_AUTH_KEY>",
  };
  const COMETCHAT_LAUNCH_OPTIONS = {
    targetElementID: "cometChatMount",
    isDocked: true,
    width: "700px",
    height: "400px",
  };

  window.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
    CometChatApp.init(COMETCHAT_CREDENTIALS)
      .then(() => CometChatApp.login({ uid: "<USER_UID>" }))
      .then(() => CometChatApp.launch(COMETCHAT_LAUNCH_OPTIONS))
      .catch((error) => console.error("[CometChat] Error:", error));
  });
</script>
```

> üìù Replace `<YOUR_APP_ID>`, `<YOUR_APP_REGION>`, `<YOUR_AUTH_KEY>`, and `<USER_UID>` with your actual values from the CometChat Dashboard.
