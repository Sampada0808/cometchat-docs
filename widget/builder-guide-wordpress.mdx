You can integrate the **CometChat Chat Builder widget** into your WordPress website to enable real-time chat functionality.

## **What You‚Äôll Build**

- Initialize the chat widget when the page loads
- Automatically log in a predefined user
- Launch a docked chat interface across your site

---

## **Register on CometChat and Get Your Application Keys**

Before integrating CometChat into your WordPress site, you need to create an account and obtain your App ID, Region, and Auth Key.

### **Steps**

1. Go to [CometChat Dashboard](https://app.cometchat.com/) and sign up for a free account.
2. Create a new app by clicking **+ Add App**.
3. Note down the following credentials from the created app:
   - **App ID**
   - **Region**
   - **Auth Key**

## **Option 1: Embed Widget Site-wide via Theme**

You can inject the widget in your WordPress site globally by editing your theme‚Äôs footer.

### **Steps**

1. Go to your WordPress Admin Panel
2. Navigate to **Appearance ‚Üí Theme File Editor**
3. Select the `footer.php` file under **Theme Files**
4. Paste the following code just before the `</body>` tag:

```html highlight={1, 5-9, 19}
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/cometchat-visual-builder-no-code@latest/dist/main.js" defer></script>

<div id="cometChatMount"></div>
<script>
  const COMETCHAT_CREDENTIALS = {
    appID: "<YOUR_APP_ID>",
    appRegion: "<YOUR_APP_REGION>",
    authKey: "<YOUR_AUTH_KEY>",
  };
  const COMETCHAT_LAUNCH_OPTIONS = {
    targetElementID: "cometChatMount",
    isDocked: true,
    width: "700px",
    height: "400px",
  };

  window.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
    CometChatApp.init(COMETCHAT_CREDENTIALS)
      .then(() => CometChatApp.login({ uid: "<USER_UID>" }))
      .then(() => CometChatApp.launch(COMETCHAT_LAUNCH_OPTIONS))
      .catch((error) => console.error("[CometChat] Error:", error));
  });
</script>
```

> üìù Replace the placeholder values (`<YOUR_APP_ID>`, `<YOUR_APP_REGION>`, `<YOUR_AUTH_KEY>`, and `<USER_UID>`) with your actual CometChat app credentials.

---

## **Option 2: Embed Widget on a Specific Page or Post**

If you want to add the widget to a single page or post:

1. Open the WordPress Editor for that page or post
2. Add a **Custom HTML block**
3. Paste the full widget code (as shown above)
4. Save or update the page

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Some themes or caching plugins may block inline JavaScript. If the widget doesn't appear, use the theme footer method instead.

---

## ‚ùó Troubleshooting

- **Widget not loading?** Ensure your `appID`, `region`, and `authKey` are correct.
- **User login fails?** Confirm the `uid` exists in your CometChat app under Users.
- **Script blocked?** Use the footer integration method instead of inline HTML blocks.
