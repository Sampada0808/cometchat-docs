## **Option 1: Embed Widget on All Pages via Shopify Theme**

This method ensures the widget loads on every page of your site.

### **Steps**

1. **Login to Shopify Admin**

   Go to [Shopify Admin](https://admin.shopify.com/) and select your store.

2. **Navigate to Online Store → Themes**

   Under **Current theme**, click `Actions → Edit Code`.

3. **Open the `theme.liquid` File**

   In the **Layout** folder, click on `theme.liquid`.

4. **Paste Widget Code Before `</body>` Tag**

   Scroll to the bottom and insert the code just before the closing `</body>` tag:

   ```html
   <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/cometchat-visual-builder-no-code@latest/dist/main.js" defer></script>

   <div id="cometChatMount"></div>
   <script>
     const COMETCHAT_CREDENTIALS = {
       appID: "2714049736676d4b",
       appRegion: "us",
       authKey: "435272222b8448e6c38c37d1b552702ec2b48b18",
     };
     const COMETCHAT_LAUNCH_OPTIONS = {
       targetElementID: "cometChatMount",
       isDocked: true,
       width: "700px",
       height: "400px",
     };

     window.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
       CometChatApp.init(COMETCHAT_CREDENTIALS)
         .then(() => CometChatApp.login({ uid: "cometchat-uid-1" }))
         .then((user) => CometChatApp.launch(COMETCHAT_LAUNCH_OPTIONS))
         .catch((error) => console.error("[CometChat] Error:", error));
     });
   </script>
   ```

5. **Click Save**

   The widget should now be active across all pages of your site.

## **Option 2: Embed Widget on a Specific Page**

If you prefer to show the widget only on one page (like your Contact page):

1. Go to **Online Store → Pages** and choose the page.
2. Click the `<>` icon to enter HTML editing mode.
3. Paste the full widget code.
4. Save the page.

> ⚠️ Shopify may restrict custom scripts in content blocks. Test the widget functionality after saving.

## **Using Shopify Online Store 2.0 App Blocks (Advanced)**

If your theme supports **Shopify 2.0 app blocks**, you can create a **custom Liquid section** or **app embed block** to manage the widget.
