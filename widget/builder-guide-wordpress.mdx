You can integrate the **CometChat Chat Builder widget** into your WordPress site using the official plugin—no manual code injections required.

Once set up, it will:  
- Initialize the chat widget when the page loads  
- Automatically log in a predefined user (optional)  
- Launch a docked chat interface across your site  

## 1. Register on CometChat & Gather Your Keys

Before you begin, sign in at the [CometChat Dashboard](https://app.cometchat.com/) and create a new app. Copy down:  
- **App ID**  
- **Region**  
- **Auth Key**  

## 2. Download & Install the Plugin

1. **Download** the latest CometChat WordPress plugin ZIP from your CometChat account or the docs site.  
2. In your WordPress Admin, navigate to **Plugins → Add New**.  
3. Click **Upload Plugin**, choose the downloaded `cometchat-chat-builder.zip`, then click **Install Now**.  
4. After installation, click **Activate Plugin**.  

## 3. Configure Plugin Settings

1. In the WordPress Admin sidebar, go to **CometChat Chat Builder**.  
2. Under **General Settings**, enter:  
   - **App ID**: `<YOUR_APP_ID>`  
   - **Region**: `<YOUR_APP_REGION>`  
   - **Auth Key**: `<YOUR_AUTH_KEY>`  
3. (Optional) Set **Default User UID** if you want the widget to auto-login a specific CometChat user.  
4. Choose **Display Mode**:  
   - **Site-wide** (widget appears on every page)  
   - **Shortcode only** (you’ll insert `[cometchat_widget]` where needed)  
5. Click **Save Changes**.  

## 4. Add the Chat Widget to Your Pages

- **Site-wide**  
  The chat will now be docked on every public page automatically.  

- **Shortcode**  
  Edit any Page/Post, add a **Shortcode** block, and insert:  
  ```text
  [cometchat_widget width="700px" height="400px"]
  ```

- **Theme Template**  
  Developers can include it directly in PHP templates:  
  ```php
  <?php echo do_shortcode('[cometchat_widget]'); ?>
  ```

## 5. Troubleshooting

- **Plugin not uploading**  
  - Verify that the ZIP file is intact and you’re selecting the correct file.  
- **Settings won’t save**  
  - Temporarily disable caching or minification plugins and retry.  
- **Widget not loading**  
  - Double-check your App ID, Region, and Auth Key in **CometChat Chat Builder** settings.  
  - Inspect the browser console for any errors.
