You can integrate the **CometChat Visual Builder widget** into your Squarespace website to provide real-time chat functionality.

## **Step 1: Register on CometChat and Get Your Application Keys**

Before integrating CometChat, you need to create an account and obtain your App ID, Region, and Auth Key.

### **Steps**

1. Go to [CometChat Dashboard](https://app.cometchat.com/) and sign up for a free account.
2. Create a new app by clicking **+ Add App**.
3. Note down the following credentials from the created app:
   - **App ID**
   - **Region**
   - **Auth Key**

---

## **Step 2: Embed the Widget Code via Code Injection**

Squarespace allows you to inject custom code into the header or footer of your site.

### **Steps**

1. Go to your **Squarespace Admin Dashboard**.
2. Navigate to **Settings â†’ Advanced â†’ Code Injection**.
3. In the **Footer** section, paste the following code:

   ```html highlight={1, 5-9}
   <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/cometchat-visual-builder-no-code@latest/dist/main.js" defer></script>

   <div id="cometChatMount"></div>
   <script>
     const COMETCHAT_CREDENTIALS = {
       appID: "",
       appRegion: "",
       authKey: "",
     };
     const COMETCHAT_LAUNCH_OPTIONS = {
       targetElementID: "cometChatMount",
       isDocked: true,
       width: "700px",
       height: "400px",
     };

     window.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
       CometChatApp.init(COMETCHAT_CREDENTIALS)
         .then(() => CometChatApp.login({ uid: "cometchat-uid-1" }))
         .then((user) => CometChatApp.launch(COMETCHAT_LAUNCH_OPTIONS))
         .catch((error) => console.error("[CometChat] Error:", error));
     });
   </script>
   ```

4. Click **Save**.

Once saved, the CometChat widget will appear across your entire Squarespace site.

> ðŸ’¡ If you'd like to target a specific page, use the **Page Settings â†’ Advanced â†’ Page Header Code Injection** instead of the global footer.
