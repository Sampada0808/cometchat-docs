Messaging is one of the core features of CometChat. We've thoughtfully created methods to help you send, receive and fetch message history.

At the minimum, you must add code for [sending messages](/docs/sdk/ionic/2.0/messaging-send-message) and [receiving messages](/docs/sdk/ionic/2.0/messaging-receive-messages)

Once you've implemented that, you can proceed to more advanced features like [typing indicators](/docs/sdk/ionic/2.0/messaging-typing-indicators) and [delivery & read receipts](/docs/sdk/ionic/2.0/messaging-receipts).
