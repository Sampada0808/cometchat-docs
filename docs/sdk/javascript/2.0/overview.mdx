This guide demonstrates how to add chat to a JavaScript application using CometChat. Before you begin, we strongly recommend you read the [Key Concepts](/docs/sdk/javascript/2.0/key-concepts) guide.

#### I want to integrate with my app

1. [Get your application keys](overview#get-your-application-keys)
2. [Add the CometChat dependency](overview#add-the-cometchat-dependency)
3. [Initialize CometChat](overview#initialize-cometchat)
4. [Register and Login your user](overview#register-and-login-your-user)
5. [Integrate our UI Kits](overview#integrate-our-ui-kits)
6. [Integrate our Chat Widget](overview#integrate-our-chat-widget)

#### I want to explore a sample app (includes UI)

Open the app folder in your favourite code editor and follow the steps mentioned in the `README.md` file.

[React Sample App](https://github.com/cometchat/cometchat-chat-sample-app-react/tree/v2)

[Angular Sample App](https://github.com/cometchat/cometchat-chat-sample-app-angular/tree/v2)

[Vue Sample App](https://github.com/cometchat/cometchat-chat-sample-app-vue/tree/v2)

### Get your Application Keys

[Signup for CometChat](https://app.cometchat.com) and then:

1. Create a new app
2. Head over to the **API & Auth Keys** section and note the **Auth Key**, **App ID** & **Region**

## Add the CometChat Dependency

### NPM

<Tabs>
<Tab title="JavaScript">
```bash
npm install @cometchat-pro/chat@2.4.1 --save
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

Then, import the `CometChat` object wherever you want to use CometChat.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="JavaScript">
```javascript
import { CometChat } from "@cometchat-pro/chat";
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

### HTML (via CDN)

Include the CometChat JavaScript library in your HTML code

<Tabs>
<Tab title="HTML">
```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://unpkg.com/@cometchat-pro/chat@2.4.1/CometChat.js"></script>
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

## Initialize CometChat

The `init()` method initialises the settings required for CometChat. The `init()` method takes the below parameters:

1. appID - Your CometChat App ID
2. appSettings - An object of the AppSettings class can be created using the AppSettingsBuilder class. The region field is mandatory and can be set using the `setRegion()` method.

The `AppSettings` class allows you to configure two settings:

* **Region**: The region where you app was created.
* [Presence Subscription](/docs/sdk/javascript/2.0/user-presence)

You need to call `init()` before calling any other method from CometChat. We suggest you call the `init()` method on app startup, preferably in the `index.js` file.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="JavaScript">
```javascript
let appID = "APP_ID";
let region = "APP_REGION";
let appSetting = new CometChat.AppSettingsBuilder()
                  .subscribePresenceForAllUsers()
                  .setRegion(region)
                  .build();
CometChat.init(appID, appSetting).then(
() => {
  console.log("Initialization completed successfully");
}, error => {
  console.log("Initialization failed with error:", error);
}
);
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

Make sure you replace the `APP_ID` with your CometChat **App ID** and `APP_REGION` with your **App Region** in the above code.

## Register and Login your user

Once initialization is successful, you will need to create a user. To create users on the fly, you can use the `createUser()` method. This method takes a `User` object and the `Auth Key` as input parameters and returns the created `User` object if the request is successful.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="JavaScript">
```javascript
let authKey = "AUTH_KEY";
var UID = "user1";
var name = "Kevin";

var user = new CometChat.User(UID);

user.setName(name);

CometChat.createUser(user, authKey).then(
  user => {
      console.log("user created", user);
  },error => {
      console.log("error", error);
  }
)
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

Make sure that `UID` and `name` are specified as these are mandatory fields to create a user.

Once you have created the user successfully, you will need to log the user into CometChat using the `login()` method.

We recommend you call the CometChat `login()` method once your user logs into your app. The `login()` method needs to be called only once.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="JavaScript">
```javascript
var UID = "cometchat-uid-1";
var authKey = "AUTH_KEY";

CometChat.getLoggedinUser().then(
  (user) => {
  			if(!user){
          CometChat.login(UID, authKey).then(
            user => {
              console.log("Login Successful:", { user });    
            }, error => {
              console.log("Login failed with exception:", { error });    
            }
          );
      }
  	}, error => {
  			console.log("Some Error Occured", { error });
  	}
);
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

Make sure you replace the `AUTH_KEY` with your CometChat **AuthKey** in the above code.

<Note>
Sample Users

We have set-up 5 users for testing having UIDs: `cometchat-uid-1`, `cometchat-uid-2`, `cometchat-uid-3`, `cometchat-uid-4` and `cometchat-uid-5`.

</Note>

The `login()` method returns the `User` object on `Promise` resolved containing all the information of the logged in user.

<Warning>

UID can be alphanumeric with underscore and hyphen. Spaces, punctuation and other special characters are not allowed.

</Warning>
