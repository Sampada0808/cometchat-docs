title: "Session Timeout Flow"
---



Available since v4.2.0

## Overview

CometChat Calls SDK provides a mechanism to handle session timeouts for idle participants. By default, if a participant is alone in a call session for 180 seconds (3 minutes), the following sequence is triggered:

1. After 120 seconds of being alone in the session, the participant will see a dialog box

2. This dialog provides options to either:

   * Stay in the call
   * Leave immediately

3. If no action is taken within the next 60 seconds, the call will automatically end

This feature helps manage inactive call sessions and prevents unnecessary resource usage. The idle timeout period ensures that participants don't accidentally remain in abandoned call sessions.

<Tip>

The `onSessionTimeout` event is triggered when the call automatically terminates due to session timeout, as illustrated in the diagram above.
