To begin managing rules:

* Login to your [CometChat dashboard](https://app.cometchat.com/login) and choose your app.
* Navigate to **Moderation** > **Settings** in the left-hand menu.
* Select the **Rules** tab.

## Default Rules

Default rules are predefined sets of message moderation conditions that are readily available for use on your platform, and automatically applied to moderate messages when enabled. These default rules form the foundation of an effective message moderation strategy, combining automation with customizable options to ensure a safe, respectful, and compliant environment for platform users. Here are the standard default rules available:

### Profanity Filter

This feature automatically detects and manages text and custom messages containing offensive language, profanity, or derogatory remarks using a predefined list of offensive keywords to block inappropriate content. Ensuring user interactions maintain a respectful tone and comply with community standards, enhances overall platform decency.

**Example**

Before enabling the profanity filter, messages containing profane words are delivered to the receiver, as indicated by double ticks in the message status. After enabling the filter, such messages are not delivered to the receiver, which is indicated by a single tick in the message status.

## Rule Filters, Conditions and Actions

### Filters

Filters allow you to narrow down messages based on the Sender or Receiver of a message.

For Senders, you can filter by specific properties like UID, Role, Name, and Tags, or see when the sender was created. Similarly, for Receivers, you can filter by properties such as Name, GUID, Tags, Group type or see when the receiver was created, and the Type of receiver (for example, a user or group). This enables targeted filtering based on user or group attributes within the conversation.

### Conditions

Conditions allow you to define criteria for blocking messages based on their type—text, image, video, or custom.

You can select a keyword list, define a list of words or patterns, for text and custom messages. 

In addition to selecting specific words, patterns, or lists for text and custom messages, you can also choose filters based on Toxicity, Sentiment, or Sentence Similarity for more advanced moderation and content analysis. You can refine Toxicity filtering by selecting categories such as Identity Attack, Insult, Obscene, Mild Toxicity, or Severe Toxicity. For Sentiment, you can choose to filter messages based on positive or negative sentiment. In Sentence Similarity, you have the option to apply a default or custom list. Additionally, you can set a confidence percentage for each criterion to determine the threshold for blocking messages.

For media messages you can select among categories like Violence, Gambling, Alcohol, Drugs and Tobacco, Rude gestures, Explicity nudity, Non-explicit nudity, Swimwear or underwear, Visually disturbing, Hate symbols or Any unsafe content. Additionally, you can set a confidence percentage for each criterion to determine the threshold for blocking messages.

### Actions

Actions specify what happens when content matches the conditions. In addition to blocking the message by default, actions include options such as banning or kicking a user from a group and blocking a user.

## Configuring rules

### Create Rule

Allows you to define new moderation rules specifying the conditions under which messages should be blocked.
