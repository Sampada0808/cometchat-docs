</Frame>

All the messages that match the moderation criteria will get listed from oldest to newest. You can perform the following actions for a particular message:

1. **Approve:** The message gets sent to the Receiver and disappears from the list.
2. **Reject:** The message gets deleted and is not sent to the intended receiver.
3. **Kick:** Available for Group conversations. A notorious user gets kicked out of the group. They can rejoin the group.
4. **Ban:** Available for Group conversations. A notorious user gets banned from the group. They cannot rejoin later unless they are unbanned.

Apart from the above actions, you can also quickly access the Settings for the Extension. You can toggle Auto-refresh Messages and also toggle the Switch to Enable/Disable the Moderation.

<Warning>

If you disable the Extension, only the new messages will flow without being routed through the In-flight Message Moderation Section. However, the existing messages that you see in the section will have to be Approved in order to be received by the intended recipient.
