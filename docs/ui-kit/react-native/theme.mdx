## Overview

Theming in CometChat for React Native allows you to create visually consistent and customizable user interfaces that align with your application's branding. The CometChatThemeProvider acts as a global theme provider, enabling seamless integration of light and dark modes while giving you the flexibility to define custom colors, typography, and component-specific styles.

At the core of theming is the CometChatTheme interface, which defines the structure of the theme supplied to the provider. This interface lets you specify various theme attributes such as colors, fonts, and component-level customizations. By wrapping your application with CometChatThemeProvider and supplying a CometChatTheme, you can maintain a consistent look and feel across all CometChat components while having full control over customizations to match your app’s aesthetic.

## Using Theming in Your Project

By default, the theme is automatically selected based on the system settings, ensuring that your app aligns with the user's preferred light or dark mode unless you choose to override it with a custom theme.

The CometChatThemeProvider is used to apply a custom theme to your components. By setting the theme prop with a specific mode, such as `{ mode: 'dark' }`, you can override the default system theme and ensure that the UI is displayed in the desired light or dark mode. This allows you to provide a consistent visual experience based on the selected theme mode.

<Warning>

To ensure the app dynamically adapts to the device's OS-level light or dark theme, it must be wrapped in the CometChatThemeProvider. Without this wrapper, system theme changes will not be reflected in the app's UI.

</Warning>

Here’s an example of how to explicitly set the theme mode to `light`:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="TypeScript">
```ts
return (
  <SafeAreaView style={{ flex: 1 }}>
    <CometChatThemeProvider theme={{ mode: "light" }}>
      {/* Component */}
    </CometChatThemeProvider>
  </SafeAreaView>
);
```

## Customization

To customize the primary color in your app, you can override the primary color attribute in the theme. Here's how to override the primary color for light theme:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="TypeScript">
```ts
return (
  <SafeAreaView style={{ flex: 1 }}>
    <CometChatThemeProvider
      theme={{
        light: {
          color: {
            primary: "#F76808",
          },
        },
      }}
    >
      {/* Component */}
    </CometChatThemeProvider>
  </SafeAreaView>
);
```

</Tab>

<Tip>

All default icons are implemented as SVGs.

For these icons, only the following imageStyle properties are supported:

* tintColor
* height
* width

Any extra properties provided in imageStyle will be ignored for default icons.

For custom icons, you can provide either JSX components or an ImageSourcePropType. JSX Components: These are rendered as-is, and no additional styles are applied.

ImageSourcePropType (e.g., PNG, JPEG): The entire imageStyle passed will be applied to the image as expected.

</Tip>

### Overriding the Theme for Specific Components by Customizing Style Properties

Following is an example of how the light theme for the CometChatConversations component is overridden directly by setting custom theme properties within the CometChatThemeProvider. This ensures that the CometChatConversations component uses a specific light theme, independent of the global theme applied to the rest of the app. The light theme is customized further by defining specific styles, such as the background color for the conversation container. This approach allows you to customize the theme for specific components while keeping the global theme intact.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="App.tsx">
```tsx
import {
  CometChatConversations,
  CometChatUIKit,
  CometChatUiKitConstants,
  UIKitSettings,
  useTheme,
} from "@cometchat/chat-uikit-react-native";
import { CometChatThemeProvider } from "@cometchat/chat-uikit-react-native/src/theme/provider";
import Messages from "./src/Messages";

//other code

const theme = useTheme();

return (
  <SafeAreaView style={{ flex: 1 }}>
    <CometChatThemeProvider
      theme={{
        light: {
          conversationStyles: {
            containerStyle: {
              backgroundColor: theme.color.extendedPrimary500,
            },
          },
        },
      }}
    >
      {loggedIn && (
        <>
          <CometChatConversations
            style={{
              containerStyle: {
                display: messageUser || messageGroup ? "none" : "flex",
              },
            }}
            onItemPress={(item: CometChat.Conversation) => {
              if (
                item.getConversationType() ==
                CometChatUiKitConstants.ConversationTypeConstants.user
              ) {
                setMessageUser(item.getConversationWith() as CometChat.User);
                return;
              }
              setMessageGroup(item.getConversationWith() as CometChat.Group);
            }}
          ></CometChatConversations>
          {(messageUser || messageGroup) && (
            <Messages
              user={messageUser}
              group={messageGroup}
              onBack={() => {
                setMessageUser(undefined);
                setMessageGroup(undefined);
              }}
            />
          )}
        </>
      )}
    </CometChatThemeProvider>
  </SafeAreaView>
);
```

### Supplying Custom Theme to Specific Components by wrapping them in a separate CometChatThemeProvider

Following is an example of how the theme for the CometChatConversations component is specifically overridden by wrapping it in a separate CometChatThemeProvider. This allows the CometChatConversations component to use a dark mode theme, independent of the global theme applied to the rest of the app. Additionally, the dark theme is further customized for the component by defining specific styles, such as the background color for the conversation container. This approach enables you to tailor the theme for specific components while maintaining the overall consistency of the global theme.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="App.tsx">
```tsx
import {
  CometChatConversations,
  CometChatUIKit,
  CometChatUiKitConstants,
  UIKitSettings,
  useTheme,
  CometChatThemeProvider,
} from "@cometchat/chat-uikit-react-native";
import Messages from "./src/Messages";

//other code

const theme = useTheme();

return (
  <SafeAreaView style={{ flex: 1 }}>
    <CometChatThemeProvider>
      {loggedIn && (
        <>
          <CometChatThemeProvider
            theme={{
              mode: "dark",
              dark: {
                conversationStyles: {
                  containerStyle: {
                    backgroundColor: theme.color.extendedPrimary600,
                  },
                },
              },
            }}
          >
            <CometChatConversations
              style={{
                containerStyle: {
                  display: messageUser || messageGroup ? "none" : "flex",
                },
              }}
              onItemPress={(item: CometChat.Conversation) => {
                if (
                  item.getConversationType() ==
                  CometChatUiKitConstants.ConversationTypeConstants.user
                ) {
                  setMessageUser(item.getConversationWith() as CometChat.User);
                  return;
                }
                setMessageGroup(item.getConversationWith() as CometChat.Group);
              }}
            ></CometChatConversations>
          </CometChatThemeProvider>
          {(messageUser || messageGroup) && (
            <Messages
              user={messageUser}
              group={messageGroup}
              onBack={() => {
                setMessageUser(undefined);
                setMessageGroup(undefined);
              }}
            />
          )}
        </>
      )}
    </CometChatThemeProvider>
  </SafeAreaView>
);
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

<Note>

When customizing theme properties, whether by overriding specific properties or supplying a completely custom theme, the provided values will be deeply merged with the default theme. This means that only the specified properties will be overridden, while all other properties will retain their default values. Additionally, if a style is passed through props, it will take priority over the style provided via the theme. The deep merge will occur in the following order of priority:

1. The style prop (highest priority)
2. The custom theme
3. The default theme (lowest priority)

This ensures that customizations are prioritized and applied while preserving the integrity of the default theme.

```ts
// The custom theme is merged with the default theme (handled internally)
const mergedTheme = internalDeepMergeImplementation(defaultTheme, customTheme);

// The style prop is applied with higher priority, merging it with the previous result (handled internally)
const finalConversationsStyle = internalDeepMergeImplementation(
  mergedTheme,
  conversationStyleProp
);
```

</Note>
