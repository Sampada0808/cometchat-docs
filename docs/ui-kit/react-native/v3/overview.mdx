### Configure CometChat inside your React Native app

* Initialize CometChat ðŸŒŸ

The init() method initializes the settings required for CometChat. We suggest calling the init() method on app startup, preferably in the created() method of the Application class.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="JavaScript">
```js
import {CometChat} from '@cometchat-pro/react-native-chat';

const appID = 'APP_ID';
const region = 'REGION';
const appSetting = new CometChat.AppSettingsBuilder()
  .subscribePresenceForAllUsers()
  .setRegion(region)
  .build();
CometChat.init(appID, appSetting).then(
  () => {
    console.log('Initialization completed successfully');
    // You can now call login function.
  },
  (error) => {
    console.log('Initialization failed with error:', error);
    // Check the reason for error and take appropriate action.
  },
);
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

<Warning>

Replace APP\_ID and REGION with your CometChat App ID and Region in the above code

</Warning>

* Login your user ðŸ‘¤

This method takes UID and Auth Key as input parameters and returns the User object containing all the information of the logged-in user.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="JavaScript">
```js
import {CometChat} from '@cometchat-pro/react-native-chat';

const authKey = 'AUTH_KEY';
const uid = 'cometchat-uid-1';

CometChat.login(uid, authKey).then(
  (user) => {
    console.log('Login Successful:', { user });
  },
  (error) => {
    console.log('Login failed with exception:', { error });
  },
);
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

<Warning>

Replace AUTH\_KEY with your CometChat Auth Key in the above code.

</Warning>

<Note>
We have set up 5 users for testing having UIDs: cometchat-uid-1, cometchat-uid-2, cometchat-uid-3, cometchat-uid-4, and cometchat-uid-5.

We have used uid cometchat-uid-1 as an example here. You can create a User from CometChat Dashboard as well.
