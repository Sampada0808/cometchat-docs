## Installing iOS Chat UI Kit

### 1. Setup üîß

**i. Register on CometChat üßëüíª**

* To install iOS UI Kit, you need to first register on **CometChat Dashboard**. [Click here to sign up](https://app.cometchat.com/login).

**ii. Get Your Application Keys üîë**

* Create a **new app**
* Head over to the **QuickStart** or **API & Auth Keys section** and note the **App ID**, **Auth Key**, and **Region**.

**iii. Add the CometChat Dependency**üì¶

We recommend using CocoaPods, as they are the most advanced way of managing iOS project dependencies. Open a terminal window, move to your project directory, and then create a Podfile by running the following command

Create podfile using the below command.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Bash">
```sh
$ pod init
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

Add the following lines to the Podfile.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Bash">
```sh
For Xcode 12 and above:

platform :ios, '11.0'
use_frameworks!

target 'YourApp' do
     pod 'CometChatPro', '2.4.1'
     pod 'CometChatCalls', '2.1.1'
end
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

<Warning>

v2.4.1+ onwards, Voice & Video Calling functionality has been moved to a separate framework. In case you do not plan to use the calling feature, please add the Calling framework `pod 'CometChatCalls', '2.1.1'` in your app Podfile.

</Warning>

And then install the CometChatPro framework through CocoaPods.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Bash">
```sh
pod install
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

If you're facing any issues while installing pods then use the below command.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Bash">
```sh
pod install --repo-update
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

***

### 2. Configure CometChat inside your app

**i. Initialize CometChat üé¨**

The `init()` method initializes the settings required for CometChat. We suggest calling the `init()` method on app startup, preferably in the `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions()` method of the Application class.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Swift">
```swift
import CometChatPro

class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate{

   var window: UIWindow?
   let appId: String = "ENTER APP ID"
   let region: String = "ENTER REGION CODE"
    
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {

let mySettings = AppSettings.AppSettingsBuilder().subscribePresenceForAllUsers().setRegion(region:   region).build()
CometChat(appId: appId ,appSettings: mySettings,onSuccess: { (isSuccess) in
       print("CometChat Pro SDK intialise successfully.")
   }) { (error) in
       print("CometChat Pro SDK failed intialise with error: \(error.errorDescription)")
    }
    return true
    }
}
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

<Warning>

Make sure you replace the **appId** with your CometChat *appId* and *region* with your app region in the above code.

</Warning>

**ii. Create User** üê£

This method takes a `User` object and the `Auth Key` as input parameters and returns the created `User` object if the request is successful.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Swift">
```swift
let uid = "user1"
let name = "Kevin"
let authKey = "AUTH_KEY"

let newUser : User = User(uid: uid, name: name)
newUser.avatar = "ENTER AVATAR URL HERE"

CometChat.createUser(user: newUser, apiKey: authKey, onSuccess: { (User) in
      print("User created successfully. \(User.stringValue())")
  }) { (error) in
     print("The error is \(String(describing: error?.description))")
}
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

**ii. Log in your User**üë§

The `login()` method returns the User object containing all the information of the `logged-in user.`

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Swift">
```swift
let uid    = "cometchat-uid-1"
let authKey = "ENTER AUTH KEY"

CometChat.login(UID: uid, apiKey: authKey, onSuccess: { (user) in
  print("Login successful: " + user.stringValue())
}) { (error) in
  print("Login failed with error: " + error.errorDescription);
}
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

<Note>

* Make sure you replace the authKey with your CometChat Auth Key in the above code.

* We have set up 5 users for testing having UIDs: cometchat-uid-1, cometchat-uid-2, cometchat-uid-3, cometchat-uid-4, and cometchat-uid-5.

</Note>

***

### 3. Add UI Kit to your project

To integrate **CometChat UIKit** inside your app. Kindly follow the below steps:

i. Simply **clone the UIKit Library** from the below repository.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="CLI">
```sh
git clone https://github.com/cometchat-pro/ios-swift-chat-ui-kit.git

</Tab>

</Tabs>

ii. After cloning the repository, Navigate to the `Library` folder and drag and drop the `Library` folder inside your project's folder.

</Frame>

iii. Make sure you've selected ‚úÖ Copy items if needed as well as üîò Create group options while adding a \`Library inside your project.

iv. If the Library is added successfully, all added folders will be in Yellow color.

</Frame>

CometChatUI is an option to launch a fully functional chat application using the UI Kit. In UI Kit all the UI Components are interlinked and work together to launch a fully functional chat on your website/application.

To use **CometChatUI** user has to launch `CometChatUI` class. **CometChatUI** is a subclass of UITabbarController.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Swift">
```swift
DispatchQueue.main.async {
let cometChatUI = CometChatUI()
cometChatUI.setup(withStyle: .fullScreen)
self.present(cometChatUI, animated: true, completion: nil)
}
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

<Warning>

Please run the above code snippet in the main thread.

</Warning>

***

### 5. Receive Real-time calls (Optional)

To receive real-time call events when the app is in foreground, the user has to register for them in the **App Delegate** class.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Swift">
```swift
CometChatCallManager().registerForCalls(application: self)
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

<Note>

* **This method only allows user to launch the incoming call screen and other calling events when the app is in foreground mode.**

</Note>
