## Installing the iOS Chat UI Kit

### 1. Setup üîß

**i. Register on CometChat üßëüíª**

* To install iOS Chat UI Kit, you need to first register on **CometChat Dashboard**. [Click here to sign up](https://app.cometchat.com/login).

**ii. Get Your Application Keys üîë**

* Create a **new app**
* Head over to the **QuickStart** or **API & Auth Keys section** and note the **App ID**, **Auth Key**, and **Region**.

**iii. Add the CometChat Dependency**üì¶

We recommend using CocoaPods, as they are the most advanced way of managing iOS project dependencies. Open a terminal window, move to your project directory, and then create a Podfile by running the following command

Create podfile using the below command.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Bash">
```sh
$ pod init
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

Add the following lines to the Podfile.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Bash">
```sh
For Xcode 12 and above:

platform :ios, '12.0'
use_frameworks!

target 'YourApp' do
     pod 'CometChatPro', '3.0.919'
     pod 'CometChatCalls', '3.0.0'
end
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

And then install the CometChat framework through CocoaPods.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Bash">
```sh
pod install
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

If you're facing any issues while installing pods then use the below command.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Bash">
```sh
pod install --repo-update
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

***

### 2. Configure CometChat inside your iOS app

**i. Initialize CometChat üé¨**

The `init()` method initializes the settings required for CometChat. We suggest calling the `init()` method on app startup, preferably in the `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions()` method of the Application class.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Swift">
```swift
import CometChatPro

class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate{

   var window: UIWindow?
   let appId: String = "ENTER APP ID"
   let region: String = "ENTER REGION CODE"
    
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {

let mySettings = AppSettings.AppSettingsBuilder().subscribePresenceForAllUsers().setRegion(region:   region).build()
CometChat(appId: appId ,appSettings: mySettings,onSuccess: { (isSuccess) in
       print("CometChat Pro SDK intialise successfully.")
   }) { (error) in
       print("CometChat Pro SDK failed intialise with error: \\(error.errorDescription)")
    }
    return true
    }
}
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

<Warning>

> Make sure you replace the **appId** with your CometChat *appId* and *region* with your app region in the above code.

</Warning>

**ii. Create User** üê£

This method takes a `User` object and the `Auth Key` as input parameters and returns the created `User` object if the request is successful.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Swift">
```swift
let uid = "user1"
let name = "Kevin"
let authKey = "AUTH_KEY"

let newUser : User = User(uid: uid, name: name)
newUser.avatar = "ENTER AVATAR URL HERE"

CometChat.createUser(user: newUser, apiKey: authKey, onSuccess: { (User) in
      print("User created successfully. \\(User.stringValue())")
  }) { (error) in
     print("The error is \\(String(describing: error?.description))")
}
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

**ii. Log in your User**üë§

The `login()` method returns the User object containing all the information of the `logged-in user.`

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Swift">
```swift
let uid    = "cometchat-uid-1"
let authKey = "ENTER AUTH KEY"

CometChat.login(UID: uid, apiKey: authKey, onSuccess: { (user) in
  print("Login successful: " + user.stringValue())
}) { (error) in
  print("Login failed with error: " + error.errorDescription);
}
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

<Note>

> * Make sure you replace the authKey with your CometChat Auth Key in the above code.> - We have set up 5 users for testing having UIDs: cometchat-uid-1, cometchat-uid-2, cometchat-uid-3, cometchat-uid-4, and cometchat-uid-5.

</Note>

***

CometChatUI is an option to launch a fully functional chat application using the Swift Chat UI Kit. In the iOS UI Kit all the Swift UI Components are interlinked and work together to launch a fully functional chat on your website/application.

To use **CometChatUI** user has to launch `CometChatUI` class. **CometChatUI** is a subclass of UITabbarController.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Swift">
```swift
DispatchQueue.main.async {
let cometChatUI = CometChatUI()
cometChatUI.setup(withStyle: .fullScreen)
self.present(cometChatUI, animated: true, completion: nil)
}
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

<Warning>

> Please run the above code snippet in the main thread.

</Warning>

***

### 5. Receive Real-time calls (Optional)

To receive real-time call events when the app is in foreground, the user has to register for them in the **App Delegate** class.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Swift">
```swift
CometChatCallManager().registerForCalls(application: self)
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

<Note>

> * **This method only allows user to launch the incoming call screen and other calling events when the app is in foreground mode.**

</Note>
