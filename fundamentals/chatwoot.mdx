The Chatwoot extension makes customer support seamless for your users. Instead of having two interfaces- one for chat between users and one for chat with your support team, you can use CometChat as a front-end for your customer support use case as well!

## How does it work?

* The end users of your app can send queries to the Customer Support user that you have set in the extension's settings.
* These queries will be forwarded to the configured Chatwoot inbox.
* When an agent replies to the queries, those will be sent over to CometChat and received by your end user.
* With this, your end users can communicate with each other as well as your Customer support team using the same Chat interface.
