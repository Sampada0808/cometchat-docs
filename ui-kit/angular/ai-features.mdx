## Conversation Starters

When a user initiates a new chat, the UI kit displays a list of suggested opening lines that users can select, making it easier for them to start a conversation. These suggestions are powered by CometChat's AI, which predicts contextually relevant conversation starters.

For a comprehensive understanding and guide on implementing and using the Conversation Starters, refer to our specific guide on the [Conversation Starter](/fundamentals/ai-user-copilot/conversation-starter).

Once you have successfully activated the [Conversation Starter](/fundamentals/ai-user-copilot/conversation-starter) from your CometChat Dashboard, the feature will automatically be incorporated into the [MessageList](/ui-kit/angular/message-list) Component of UI Kits.
