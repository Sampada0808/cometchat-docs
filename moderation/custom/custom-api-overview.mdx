CometChat offers AI-powered message moderation to help maintain a safe and respectful chat environment. You can choose between two moderation options:  

### **Custom API Moderation**  

If you prefer to use a third-party moderation service or your own AI model, CometChat enables integration via a **Custom Moderation API**. With this option, you can:  
- **Set Up a Webhook** – Configure an endpoint where messages will be sent for moderation.  
- **Customize Authentication** – Add security layers like basic authentication.  
- **Contextual Moderation** – Define how many previous messages from the conversation should be included in the webhook request for better analysis.  
- **Process Moderation Decisions** – CometChat processes the webhook response and applies moderation actions accordingly.

This moderation provide flexibility to enhance user safety and compliance within your chat platform.
