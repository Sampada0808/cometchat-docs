- **Define Custom Prompts** – Set specific prompts to classify and moderate messages based on your needs.  
- **Choose an AI Model** – Select the OpenAI model that best suits your moderation requirements.  
- **Contextual Moderation** – Configure how many previous messages from the conversation should be considered for better contextual understanding.  
- **Flexible Moderation Actions** – Block, allow, or take fallback actions if the API request fails.  
- **Secure API Management** – Provide and manage OpenAI credentials directly in the CometChat dashboard.  

This moderation provide flexibility to enhance user safety and compliance within your chat platform.
