## Overview

The Lists Management endpoints in the Moderation Service API provide essential tools for creating and managing lists of keywords or regex patterns that are crucial for effective message moderation. These endpoints enable app owners and collaborators to define specific terms, phrases, or patterns that, when detected in user-generated content, trigger moderation actions. The next section provides a detailed elaboration of the capabilities offered.
