We have a number of resources that will help you while integrating CometChat in your app.

You can begin with the [all real-time listeners](/sdk/ionic/3.0/resources-all-real-time-listeners) guide.

If you're upgrading from v2, we recommend reading our [upgrading from v2](/sdk/ionic/3.0/resources-upgrading-from-v2) guide.
