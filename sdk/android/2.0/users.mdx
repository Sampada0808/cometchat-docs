The primary aim for our users' functionality is to allow you to quickly retrieve and add users to CometChat.

You can begin with [user management](/sdk/android/2.0/user-management) to sync your users to CometChat. Once that is done, you can [retrieve users](/sdk/android/2.0/retrieve-users) and display them in your app.
