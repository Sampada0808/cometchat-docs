The primary aim for our Users functionality is to allow you to quickly add users to CometChat.

You can begin with [user management](/sdk/react-native/user-management) to sync your users to CometChat. Once that is done, you can [retrieve users](/sdk/react-native/retrieve-users) and display them in your app.
